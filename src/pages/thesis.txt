Plate 6 shows the devices of the UVify on a schematic diagram. The project consists of the ESP32 C3 super mini, VEML6075 UV sensor, 2000 mAh 3.7V battery, charging module, SD card module, rocker switch, buzzer, step-up booster, 0.91-inch LCD, and RTC module DS3231. The circuit is functionally partitioned into three essential subsystems: Power Management, Data Communication, and Input/Output. The Power Management system begins with the 3.7V battery connected to the charging module. Power flow is then controlled by the rocker switch before entering the step-up boost power converter, which is vital for providing regulated 5V and 3.3V rails to the microcontroller and its peripherals. For Data Communication, the ESP32 C3 employs a shared I²C bus (SDA: Pin 8, SCL: Pin 9) for the slow-speed devices—the VEML6075 sensor, RTC DS3231 (for accurate time-stamping), and the 0.91-inch OLED display. Simultaneously, it dedicates the high-speed SPI bus (Pins 4, 5, 6, and 10) exclusively to the SD card module for reliable, non-volatile data logging. Finally, in the Input/Output section, the buzzer is connected to a dedicated digital output pin (Pin 7), providing a swift and distinct audible alert to complete the core sensing, processing, and notification loop of the UVify prototype.

The UVify web application provides comprehensive UV monitoring through a responsive dashboard accessible via web browsers, enabling users to create accounts, authenticate securely, monitor real-time UV data from linked devices, configure personalized profiles based on Fitzpatrick skin types, customize alert preferences, manage sunscreen reminders, access detailed analytics and risk assessments, generate downloadable reports in multiple formats, and utilize educational resources for UV safety awareness, while system administrators oversee platform operations, data backup procedures, and user account management through a secure architecture built with React.js frontend, Node.js/Express.js backend, MongoDB database, and JWT authentication ensuring data privacy and real-time synchronization with UVify hardware devices.
